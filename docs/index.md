**Korlibs** is a set of Kotlin Common modern libraries to do full stack development aiming Kotlin 1.3.

It stands for **K**otlin c**OR**outines **LIB**raries. Though not all its library components have asynchronous parts.

It is suitable for building [backend servers or cli tools that run on JVM or Node.JS](/korio) and [desktop, web and mobile games](/korge), including [**emulators**](https://github.com/kpspemu/kpspemu), and [GUI applications](/korui).

It's philosophy is: simple, small, powerful, cohesive, enjoyable, portable, multiplatform and asynchronous.

Some of these libraries are tightly tied to provide an awesome experience.
